# QUESTION 1 -- COVID-19 TESTING

The goal of this question is to help you develop your
ability to use statistics to understand COVID-19 testing.
Imagine this is mid 2020 and you are trying to understand
how to accurately interpret COVID test results. First a
quick primer on COVID tests.

## A quick primer on COVID tests[^2]

[^2]: Sources:
    [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/covid-19-test-basics),
    [Mayo
    clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/expert-answers/covid-antibody-tests/faq-20484429).

There are two types of tests: **diagnostic tests** and
antibody tests. A diagnostic test aims at detecting whether
the person currently has an active coronavirus infection.
Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests which
detect the virus -- molecular tests, such as RT-PCR tests,
that detect the virus's genetic material, and antigen tests
that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus.

An **antibody (serology) test** aims at detecting whether
the person had an infection, by assessing whether the person
has developed antibodies against the virus. If test results
show that the person has antibodies, it indicates that the
person was likely infected with COVID-19 at some time in the
past. It may also mean that the person has some immunity.
But there is no definitive evidence on whether having
antibodies means the person is protected against reinfection
with COVID-19. The level of immunity and how long immunity
lasts are not yet known.

## Our question

We will start with antigen tests, which are diagnostic tests
that are rapid to administer and get results. We will focus
on one of the tests that have been approved by the FDA. This
test has a specificity rate (percent not infected correctly
identified as negative) of 100%. The sensitivity rate
(percent of infected correctly identified as positive) is
97%[^3]. Assume that the prevalence of COVID-19 in your
population of interest is 1.2%.

[^3]: Note that the sensitivity rate of various COVID
    antigen tests vary. This figure is from Color, the
    provider of tests for Harvard. Source:
    <https://www.color.com/covid19-details>.

(a) Calculate the probability that a person who tests
    positive is infected (i.e. P(COVID\|+)). This number is
    usually referred to as the positive predictive value of
    the test.

| **Answer: 1 - Everyone who tested positive does have COVID** |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------|

(b) Calculate the probability that a person who tests
    negative is not infected (i.e. P(NO COVID\|-)). This
    number is usually referred to as the negative predictive
    value of the test.

| **Answer: 0.9996** |
|:-------------------|

(c) Is the result in (a) substantially different than the
    ones we got for mammograms in class? If so, explain why
    this is the case. If not, explain why not. [ 2-3
    sentences]

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: Yes, the result is significantly different from the one we derived in class. This is because there are no people who do not have COVID and still test positive. This results in the second term in the denominator being zero and the overall expression being significantly higher.** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

(d) The FDA indicates that for antigen tests "positive
    results are usually highly accurate but negative results
    may need to be confirmed with a molecular test."

(d.1) Do you agree with the FDA statement? Explain why or
why not.

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: I think that people who do not test positive for COVID do not need to undergo a molecular test, as the odds of a person having COVID given they tested positive is very low (less than 4 in 10000).** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

(d.2) Suppose you are in charge of COVID testing in your
city, and are trying to evaluate whether to use this antigen
test for your citizens. Suppose you find it unacceptable for
the probability of having COVID, conditional on a negative
test, to be more than 5%. For what range of values of the
COVID prevalence rate would you expect this conditional
probability to be greater than 5%?

|                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: For a prevalence rate that is greater than 63.6%, this conditional probability would be greater than 5%.** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Now let's explore *antibody tests*, which aim at detecting
whether the person had the disease at some point in the
past. We will focus our attention on the Wadsworth New York
SARS-CoV Microsphere Immunoassay for Antibody Detection
test, which is reported to have a sensitivity of 88% and a
specificity of 98.8 [^4]%.

[^4]: Source: [The Wall Street
    Journal](https://graphics.wsj.com/dynamic-inset-iframer/?url=https://asset.wsj.net/wsjnewsgraphics/dice/antibody-test-reliability-calculator-433fb3e7-60e4-4bb9-aaa1-1f268cd14a0a/inset.json).

(e) A random person in your country gets this test and has a
    positive result. Calculate the probability that this
    person had COVID-19 at some point in the recent past. To
    do this, explain:

(e.1) How you got the prevalence rate for your country.
Note: Given COVID is still rapidly evolving, you won't find
this number easily. Take your best guess of this number
based on data that you find on sites such as [this
one](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). Do not spend
more than 10 minutes trying to estimate this number. The
goal is to get you to confront the imperfections of data in
the real world, not to turn this into a research project.

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: The prevalence rate in India is the proportion of the cumulative cases in the whole population. The website shows a total of 44.46 million cases in India for a total population of 1.38 billion. This results in a prevalance rate of 3.2%.** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

(e.2) What is the probability that this person had COVID-19
at some point in the recent past?

|                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: P(COVID \| +ve) is 0.7079. This means that there is a 71% chance this person had COVID in the past.** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

(f) Draw a graph (by hand, Excel, R or
    [**here**](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/plotting-and-graphics/))
    of the positive predictive value of the antibody test as
    a function of the prevalence of COVID-19. Describe the
    graph and discuss the implications for interpreting the
    results of antibody tests.

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: The curve for the positive prediction rate grows steeply till the prevalance rate is about 25%, post which it somewhat flattens. This implies that the positive prediction value of a antibody test is high and reliable for a prevalance rate that is higher than roughly 25%.** |

+:==========================================================+

# QUESTION 2 -- LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD ECONOMY

The purpose of this question is to help you learn about the
world economy while developing your R skills to analyze
data. This will be the first of several problem sets in
which you will be developing your R skills. There are some
hints in the Appendix below to help you with the questions
below. My advice is that you refer to the appendix only
after having tried to figure out how to do it by yourself;
this will better allow you to develop your R skills.

We strongly recommend you set up your environment as
provided in day 5 of math camp. Specifically, you should
create a subdirectory for problem set 1, keep all your data,
code, and work in that directory, and make a RStudio Project
specifically for that project directory.

The dataset for this question is an extract from World
Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI). Please download
the dataset "PS1_dataset.csv" from our Canvas website. The
dataset includes three tabs: one with variable definitions
and source information; one with the data extract that you
will use for this question; and one with the full time
series of the key variables from 1960 through 2019 for those
that may be interested.

First, familiarize yourself with the worksheet "Data Extract
(1993 and 2019)". Then import these data into R and answer
the questions below. We will focus a lot of attention on the
gross domestic product (GDP), a concept you dealt with in
your Macro class with Prof. Frankel. Note that the WDI
dataset reports GDP values in 2010 U.S. dollars, so that so
you can directly compare values in different years. Also
note that GDP and population data are not available in some
of the years in the spreadsheet. For this problem set, use
only those observations for which data are available. (A
question dealing with missing data is further below).

## GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR QUESTIONS INVOLVING R

**(1) Explore the data set:** An essential practice before
doing any data analysis is to explore the data set. Here are
some questions to ask:

-   What is the unit of observation (i.e. country, year,
    country/year, etc.)?
-   How many observations are in the data set?
-   What are the key variables in the data set?
-   For the key variables, how are they coded, what is the
    extent of missing data, and how will I deal with this
    missing data?

Once you have done this (no need to type answers to these
questions, but do answer them), create an analysis data set
in which:

-   You transform the population variables so that they are
    expressed in millions of people (for example,
    158,000,000 should become 158).
-   You transform the gdp variables so that they are
    expressed in millions of dollars
-   You keep only observations that have non-missing data
    for both population 2019 and gdp 2019.

This will be the data set you will you for the remainder of
this problem set, so assign it to an object you can use. Now
report the mean and the number of observations for gdp 2019
for this analysis data set.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# You can use this code chunk to upload the dataset.
rawdata <- read_csv("WDI Data Extract API-209 - PS 1 - 2022.csv")

data <- rawdata %>%
  mutate(pop_2019_mn = pop_2019/1000000, pop_1993_mn = pop_1993/1000000, gdp_1993_mn = gdp_1993/1000000, gdp_2019_mn = gdp_2019/1000000) %>%
  drop_na(gdp_2019) %>%
  drop_na(pop_2019)

mean_gdp_2019 <- mean(data$gdp_2019_mn)
count_gdp_2019 <- nrow(data)
mean_gdp_2019
count_gdp_2019
```

**(2) Totals:** Please calculate and report: a. Total World
GDP (expressed in trillions of 2010 dollars) and world
population in 2019 (expressed in billions of people)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
data %>%
  summarise(totalgdp = sum(gdp_2019_mn), totalpop = sum(pop_2019_mn)) %>%
#converting to trillions of USD and billions of people
  mutate(totalgdp = totalgdp/1000000, totalpop = totalpop/1000)

```

b.  Top 5 countries in terms of GDP in 2019 and their
    respective GDPs and top 5 countries in terms of
    population in 2019 and their respective populations. You
    may round your values.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
top5gdp <- data %>%
  arrange(desc(gdp_2019_mn)) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  select(country, gdp_2019_mn)



top5pop <- data %>%
  arrange(desc(pop_2019_mn)) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  select(country, pop_2019_mn)

top5gdp
top5pop

```

**(3) Central Tendencies:** Calculate GDP per capita (which
is equal to total GDP divided over population, but beware of
units) for each country in the database for 1993 and 2019.
Then report the following statistics. To help you code more
efficiently, feel free to write code chunks that answer
several of the questions below at the same time: a. GDP per
capita for the average country in 2019.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
data %>%
  mutate(gdp_per_capita_1993 = gdp_1993/pop_1993, gdp_per_capita_2019 = gdp_2019/pop_2019) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdp_per_capita_2019 = mean(gdp_per_capita_2019))

```

b.  World GDP per capita in 2019 (equal to: Total world GPD
    / Total world population).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
data%>%
  summarise(totalgdp = sum(gdp_2019), totalpop = sum(pop_2019)) %>%
  mutate(total_gdp_per_capita = totalgdp/totalpop)

```

c.  Explain what is the difference between (a) and (b) in a
    language that someone not well-versed in statistics can
    understand.

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: The first answer is the gotten by computing the average value of the GDP per capita for all countries in our dataset. The second value is a more distributed measure - that is the total GDP of the world divided by the total population of the world.** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

d.  What do you think drives the difference between (a) and
    (b)?

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: The average value of GDP per capita for all countries is higher than the GDP per capita of the whole world (that is, total GDP by total population). This is because the average is skewed or biased because of certain countries in the data set having really high GDP per capita values.** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

e.  Median GDP per capita in 2019.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
data %>%
  mutate(gdp_per_capita_1993 = gdp_1993/pop_1993, gdp_per_capita_2019 = gdp_2019/pop_2019) %>%
  summarize(median_gdp_per_capita_2019 = median(gdp_per_capita_2019))

```

f.  What do you think drives the difference between (a) and
    (e)?

|                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: The median is less sensitive to outliers (that is, the median does not jump because of the presence of some countries with really high GDP per capita values).** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

g.  The total population of all countries in 2019 with GDP
    per capita below the world mean calculated in part (a).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
data %>%
  mutate(gdp_per_capita_1993 = gdp_1993/pop_1993, gdp_per_capita_2019 = gdp_2019/pop_2019) %>%
  filter(gdp_per_capita_2019 < mean(gdp_per_capita_2019)) %>%
  summarise(totalpop = sum(pop_2019))

   

```

h.  What is your answer to (g) telling you in terms of how
    appropriate mean world GDP per capita is in
    characterizing the economic well-being of the average
    person in the world? [2-3 sentences]

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Answer: This number shows that a majority of the people (more than 80%) live in countries that have less than the mean GDP per capita in the year 2019. In other words, the GDP "overestimates" how well off the average person is in reality. Instead, only a few people (less than 20%) in the world are in a country that has more than the mean GDP per capita .** |

i.  Draw a histogram showing the distribution of GDP per
    capita in 2019, using bins that are \$2,000 wide.
    Imagine this histogram were to appear in The Economist,
    i.e. make it well-labeled and professionally looking.
    Feel free to tweet it using #api209.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.


plot <- data %>%
  mutate(gdp_per_capita_1993 = gdp_1993/pop_1993, gdp_per_capita_2019 = gdp_2019/pop_2019) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdp_per_capita_2019, color = income_group)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000) + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of GDP per capita in 2019",
       x = "GDP per capita (USD)",
       y = "Number of countries")  + 
  theme_economist() + 
  theme(legend.position = "right",legend.title = element_blank())


plot
```

**(4) Regional Variation:** The data set also contains
information for each country regarding the World Bank's
classification of region of the world and income group.
Answer the following questions:

a.  Produce a table that contains the percent of countries
    in each income group category. Make sure that the table
    is sorted from low income to high income (rather than
    alphabetically).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
library(gt)
options(digits = 4)
rawdata %>%
  group_by(income_group) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = count/sum(count) * 100) %>%
  mutate(income_cat = case_when(income_group == "Low income" ~ 1,
                                income_group == "Lower middle income" ~ 2,
                                income_group == "Upper middle income" ~ 3,
                                income_group == "High income" ~ 4)) %>%
  arrange(income_cat) %>%
  select(income_group, percent) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Income-wise Categorization of Countries",
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    income_group = "Income Group",
    percent = "Percentage (%)"
  )
```

b.  What percent of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are low
    income?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
ssa <- sum(rawdata$region == "Sub-Saharan Africa")

ssali <- sum(rawdata$income_group == "Low income" & rawdata$region == "Sub-Saharan Africa")



ssali/ssa

#50% of the countries in sub saharan africa are low income. 
```

c.  Assess whether the following statement is supported by
    the evidence: The majority of low-income countries are
    in sub-Saharan Africa.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

li <- sum(rawdata$income_group == "Low income")

```

|                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: 24 of the 31 low income countries are in sub saharan africa. Therefore, this statement is true.** |

+:==========================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

**(5) Missing data:** Missing data is, unfortunately, a fact
of life, and we face it here. While we cannot always fix the
problem of missing data, it is important to consider its
effects.

a.  The database does not have a 1993 GDP figure for how
    many countries?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.
summary(data$gdp_1993)

#The dataset does not have GDP values for 18 countries in 1993. 
```

b.  Calculate the mean GDP per capita in 1993 ignoring
    missing values.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.

data %>%
  mutate(gdp_per_capita_1993 = gdp_1993/pop_1993) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdp_per_capita_1993 =  mean(gdp_per_capita_1993, na.rm = TRUE))

```

c.  Divide countries into two groups: those who have missing
    GDP per capita data in 1993 and those that don't.
    Calculate the mean GDP per capita in 2019 for these two
    groups.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here
data %>%
  mutate(gdp_per_capita_1993 = gdp_1993/pop_1993, gdp_per_capita_2019 = gdp_2019/pop_2019) %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(is.na(gdp_per_capita_1993),1,0)) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(gdp_per_capita_2019))




```

d.  Which countries seem more likely to have missing data in
    1993? Feel free to use your answer in (c) and/or do
    additional calculations/explorations of the data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Insert your code here.

#Countries with really small populations or political instability are more likely to have missing data in 1993. 
```

**(6) Putting it all together:** In one crisp paragraph,
summarize your findings from your analyses in parts (1)-(4)?

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Answer: This dataset shows the GDP and population statistics for certain countries in 1993 and 2019. Using this dataset, we can understand that** the GDP per capita in 2019 distribution is right skewed. In fact, only less than 20% of the world's population lives in countries with GDP per capita higher than the mean value. About 14% of the countries (by count) are classified as low income as per the World Bank classification, and most of these fall in Sub Saharan Africa. |

| Option 1 Leakage = 0.2577       |
|                                 |
| Option 2 Leakage = 0.4328       |
|                                 |
| Option 3 Leakage = 0.656        |
|                                 |
| Option 1 Undercoverage = 0.6593 |
|                                 |
| Option 2 Undercoverage = 0.5719 |
|                                 |
| Option 3 Undercoverage = 0.4403 |
+---------------------------------+

+================================================+
+------------------------------------------------+

(2) Assess the advantages and disadvantages of each of the
    options. In doing so, consider the targeting
    effectiveness as well as other criteria (including
    political, logistical, and financial). Summarize your
    findings in the table below.

+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Option 1 Advantages: Ease of implementation (built on    |
| existing infrastructure of Oportunidades), low leakage   |
|                                                          |
| Option 1 Disadvantages: Highest undercoverage of all     |
| options                                                  |
|                                                          |
| Option 2 Advantages: Focus on rural communities that     |
| have been previously underserved                         |
|                                                          |
| Option 2 Disadvantages: Implementation challenges due to |
| a lack of set up in sparse communities                   |
|                                                          |
| Option 3 Advantages: Prioritization of marginalized      |
| individuals through targeting                            |
|                                                          |
| Option 3 Disadvantages: Highest leakage of all options,  |
| highest financial cost of all options                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

(3) Write one crisp paragraph to the Secretary of Social
    Development (Sedesol) recommending which option should
    be selected to target the pension program and why.
    Justify your recommendation using the advantages and
    disadvantages you identified above. The paragraph should
    be written in a language that the head of Sedesol (who
    you can assume is intelligent and well-educated, but not
    well-versed in statistics) can understand. Enter your
    answer [**here**](https://forms.gle/ZxTRv89JKLg7Psrc8).

# QUESTION 4 -- ONLINE UNIT ON DECISION ANALYSIS

The goal of this problem set question is to help you prepare
you for the class on **Decision Analysis** that will be held
on **Tuesday, September 6** (the day this problem set is
due). The idea is to get everyone familiar with the basics
of decision trees so that we can delve deeper in class on
this topic than we would be able to do if we had to go
through the basics in class.

You will be asked to engage with a short module (total
running time is about 10 minutes) and answer some questions
in a quiz. The quiz results will give me information about
overall performance of the class that I will use to prepare
class; your individual performance in the quiz will be
registered in the system but will not count towards your
grade in any way.

To get full credit for this question, you need to watch the
module and complete the quiz. The module is available
[**here**](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/109224/pages/0-introduction?module_item_id=1176542).
