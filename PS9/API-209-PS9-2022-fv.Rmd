# QUESTION 1 -- OMMITTED VARIABLE BIAS

As indicated in class, the *sign* of the bias of
$\hat{\beta_1}$ when omitting $X_2$ in the estimation of
$Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + u$ can be
summarized in the table below:

![](images/bias_sign.png)

Pick [two]{.underline} of the boxes in the table above.
Illustrate ***each*** of these 2 cases with an example.
Assume the regression equation you would like to estimate is
$Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + u$, but for some
reason (lack of data or knowledge, for example), you end up
omitting $X_2$ from the regression.

A.  Describe the variables $Y, X_1, X_2$:

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
**Answer:**

*Please enter your answer here.*

Example 1:

Y = Probability of getting diabetes for an individual

X1 = BMI of individual

X2 = Family History of Diabetes (Number of family members
with diabetes)

Example 2:

Y = Marathon Finishing Time

X1 = Age

X2 = Fitness Level
:::

------------------------------------------------------------

B.  Indicate the sign of the correlation between $X_1$ and
    $X_2$, and explain why you should expect such sign [1-2
    sentences]:

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
**Answer:**

*Please enter your answer here.*

Example 1: There is a positive correlation between X1 and X2
(people with a family history of diabetes and obesity are
more predisposed to have a higher BMI).

Example 2: There is a negative correlation between X1 and X2
(people who are older tend to have lower fitness levels than
people who are younger).
:::

------------------------------------------------------------

C.  Indicate the sign of $\beta_2$, and explain why you
    would expect such sign [1-2 sentences]:

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
**Answer:**

*Please enter your answer here.*

Example 1: beta2 is positive - Each additional member who
has diabetes in one's family increases their odds of being
diagnosed with diabetes

Example 2: beta2 is negative - A higher fitness level is
associated with a lower marathon finishing time
:::

------------------------------------------------------------

D.  Indicate the sign of the bias if you were to omit $X_2$
    from the regression, and explain why you would expect
    such sign [1-2 sentences]:

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
**Answer:**

*Please enter your answer here.*

In both cases, the bias would be positive. Without X2, the
coefficient of X1 is much larger than what it would have
been with X2 for both the examples.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------

E.  Indicate how your estimated $\hat{\beta_1}$Â is likely to
    change when omitting $X_2$ from the regression, i.e.,
    will it get larger or smaller relative to when you
    estimate the full regression (with both $X_1$ and $X_2$
    as explanatory variables)? Explain your reasoning both
    in technical terms (using your answers to the previous
    sub questions) and in terms a policymaker can understand
    (i.e., explain whether you will be over or understating
    the importance of $X_1$).

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
**Answer:**

*Please enter your answer here.*

For both examples, beta1 is likely to get larger as a result
of omitting X2 from the regression. As the bias is positive,
the coefficient is further pushed away from zero (alpha1 is
beta1 + BIAS), hence alpha1\> beta1.

Intuitively, we understand that if we remove X2 from the
regression (possibly because they are not directly
observable in the case of fitness levels or difficult to
obtain data on in the case of family history), we overstate
the importance of X1 on the dependent variable Y.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------

F.  **Training and Wages:** Suppose that wages depend on two
    factors: hours of training (`hourstraining`) and years
    of education (`educ`):

    $wage_i=\beta_0 + \beta_1 hourstraining_i + \beta_2 educ_i + u_i$

    Suppose that in a certain city, a large subsidy was
    offered to workers with low levels of schooling such
    that `hourstraining` and `educ` are negatively
    correlated. Suppose you had data on workers that live in
    the city where the program is operating, and you
    estimate:

    $wage_i=\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 hourstraining_i + v_i$

    Do you think $\hat{\alpha_1}$ is an unbiased estimator
    of the causal effect of hours of training on wages? If
    yes, explain why. If not, explain whether omitting
    `educ` from the regression is likely to lead to over or
    understating the importance of hours of training for
    wages.

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
**Answer:**

*Please enter your answer here.*

No, I do not think alpha1(hat) is an unbiased estimator of
the causal effect on hours of training on wages. This is
because there is omitted variable bias since hours of
training and education are correlated, AND education is also
a determinant of wages.\
In this case, since beta2(hat) is positive and the
correlation between X1 and X2 is negative, the sign of bias
is negative. In other words, omitting education from the
regression is likely to understate the importance of hours
of training on wages.

# QUESTION 2 -- CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS ABOUT REGRESSIONS AND RCTs

1.  For your first example in the previous question, answer
    the following question: As you move from the short
    regression (the one with only one explanatory variable)
    to the long regression (the one with the two explanatory
    variables), what do you think will happen to the
    standard error of $\hat{\beta_1}$?[^2]

[^2]: You may assume homoskedasticity to answer this
    question.

<!-- -->

A.  [x] They would increase
B.  [ ] They would stay the same
C.  [ ] They would decrease
D.  [ ] Not enough information
E.  [ ] I don't know

Select your preferred option above, and write a paragraph
below justifying your choice:

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
**Answer:**

*Please insert your answer here.*

This is a case of bias-variance trade off. By adding the
explanatory variable to our regression, we are removing the
omitted variable bias. However, since X1 and X2 are related
to each other the regression cannot disentangle the effects
from each other. As a result, the standard error of
beta1(hat) increases.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------

2.  Suppose you had a well-designed and conducted randomized
    trial (RCT) to estimate the effect of an education
    intervention on test scores. You run a regression
    $testscore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 treat + u$, where
    `testscore` represents the test score two years after
    the intervention. Explain what you think will likely
    happen to the following if we ran the same regression as
    before but included test scores at baseline (i.e.,
    before the program took place) as an additional
    explanatory variable:

<!-- -->

a.  magnitude of $\hat{\beta_1}$

b.  standard error of $\hat{\beta_1}$

    Write a paragraph below justifying your choices:

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
**Answer:**

*Please insert your answer here.*

Since this is a perfectly designed and conducted RCT, we can
assume that there is no correlation between treatment status
(treat) and baseline test scores. This means that there is
no omitted variable bias here. As a result the magnitude of
beta1(hat) will not change by introducing baseline test
scores. Similarly, because baseline test scores and
treatment status are not related, adding the extra
explanatory variable will not change the standard errors of
beta1(hat)

## OPTION 1 - Mongolia (Macro)

1.  Download the datasets and familiarize yourself with the
    data. Note that some of the data sets are huge, so you
    will need to store them in a computer with enough
    memory. Which topics are well-captured by the surveys?
    Which topics are not? Take note that while the Mongolian
    National Statistics Office provides most of their micro
    datasets in English, the reports may be in Mongolian. Be
    realistic in the language barrier constraints.

2.  Download and read the seminal paper [Growth
    Diagnostics](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/growth-diagnostics-0)
    (Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco, 2005). Between your full
    set of group members, also read the expanded ["Mindbook"
    of Growth
    Diagnostics](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/doing-growth-diagnostics-practice-mindbook)
    (Hausmann, Klinger and Wagner, 2008) and examples of
    Growth Diagnostics.

3.  Read/skim background documents on Mongolia to
    familiarize yourself with the economic context.

4.  Brainstorm some possible "tests" that you would run on
    each of the branches of the tree to identify a
    constraint. Start to think about which ones will be
    easier to conduct given the data available and which
    ones may prove challenging. If there is confusion over
    the conceptual underpinnings, consult an example growth
    diagnostic or the teaching team.

5.  Decide how you plan to organize the work. Who will do
    what? Establish some deadlines.

## OPTION 2 - Health in Brazil (Micro)

1.  Download the data sets you will need and make sure they
    contain all the data that you will need for your
    analysis. Familiarize yourself with the data.

2.  Read/skim background documents so that you familiarize
    yourself with the context.

3.  Present summary statistics for the main variables in the
    PNS, SIM, SIH and CNES data sets. Is there a lot of
    variation across municipalities and states? What
    implications does the answer to this question has in
    terms of coming up with an algorithm that could predict
    the number the burden of diseases at the municipality
    level?

4.  Start thinking about what predictors you might want to
    use to predict the burden of diseases in each
    municipality.

5.  Brainstorm some ideas for what hypotheses you might
    explore and how you might use the data to explore these
    hypotheses.

6.  Decide how you plan to organize the work. Who will do
    what? Establish some deadlines.

------------------------------------------------------------

::: answer-box
*Please enter your answers here*

3.  This shows that there is a lot of variation since many
    municipalities are clustered at lower levels of
    hospitalization and mortality, but some municipalities
    (most likely cities or urban areas) have really high
    levels of hospitalization and mortality. \
    We will explore assigning weights by population density
    in our analysis to avoid skewing disproportionately
    towards urban areas.Â 
4.  To start with, we want to dig into the following
    variables:
    1.  Current hospitalization rate

    2.  Mortality RatesÂ 

    3.  Socio-economic and health variables from PNS

    4.  Population density

    5.  Vaccination Rates

    6.  Assess trends in big cities vs small rural areas.
        Perhaps recommend different strategies for each of
        these

\
5. Brainstorm some ideas for **what hypotheses you might
explore** and how you might use the data to explore these
hypotheses.

a\. Population density is inversely related to disease
burden.

b\. Income level is inversely proportional to disease
burden.

c\. Municipalities with poor sewer system are in desperate
need of better infrastructure.

d\. The numbers in municipalities with high levels of
socio-economic inequality might not be telling theÂ  whole
story.

e\. Make clusters of municipalities

6.  Timelines:

    Launch meeting: Thursday, November 1

    Meet after API-209 classes
